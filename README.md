# React Pizza Parlor

Dream team Ia Vue, Siv Earley, Sam Marlowe, and myself, Lily LaCosse worked to bring you this Pizza Parlor app. 
We used React, Redux, and Node.js to achieve our masterpiece. 

### Group Work 

Practice working in a group has been invaluable to our learning experience. Between dividing up coding tasks, testing our code knowledge, practicing git pulls and merges, and resolving git conflicts, we have a much stronger understanding of project flow. 

Please reach out to us via email! We would be more than happy to engage with you.
